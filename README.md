# Notice:

We splitted this repository up in 3 repositories because:
##### - Semantic release doesn't support multiple NPM packages per repo
##### - Front-end developers got confused with maven and visa versa

Here are the projects:

1. [Base Module](https://github.com/adobe/aem-react-core-wcm-components-base) - Contains components that work in spa and web-component context
2. [Spa Module](https://github.com/adobe/aem-react-core-wcm-components-spa) - Contains container components that work only for the spa editor
3. [Examples](https://github.com/adobe/aem-react-core-wcm-components-examples) - An AEM maven project that uses above provide examples

This repository is discontinued.
